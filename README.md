## How to install

<!-- First a list of all the requirements to run the program 
If necessary use ### Headlines for subcategories
Detailed description of how to install the specific requirements and everything the user has to consider for the program to run properly
-->


## How to use

After running "app.py" you can head to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to view a simple website that shows an image and underneath the image is a link to generate a new image.

## How it works

<!-- Detailed description of how the program works and maybe the thought process that went into creating it -->

## Tests and results 
<!-- OPTIONAL -->

<!-- Some tests run on the program, to ensure and show that everything works without any problems
e.g. Accuracy 
-->

## Problems 

Currently there are a few major problems that will be addressed in the next few patches:
- The text can be too long and therefore won't fit on the image.
- The quotes are currently pre-generated and not generated with each new image meaning repeated quotes can and will happen.
